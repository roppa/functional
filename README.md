#Functional Reactive Programming

I'm learning a lot about this paradigm so I thoguht I would make some notes. I have been through the awesome [Asynchronous Javascript course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/asynchronous-javascript) at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) and a lot of the notes are from that.

##Installation

Download [RxJs](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and JQuery into a ```libs``` directory at the root.

##Running

Run from server of choice. I've set up an alias in my ```.zshrc``` file to just run a python HTTP server:

```alias serve="python -m SimpleHTTPServer"```

and then run it with:

```serve```
